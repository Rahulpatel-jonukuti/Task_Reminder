# Task_Reminder


In this To-Do List application, a "task" represents a primary item on your list, designed to help you organize your activities. Each task has a descriptive text and a completion status, indicating whether it's done or pending. Crucially, tasks can also serve as containers for "subtasks," allowing for a hierarchical breakdown of larger objectives into smaller, manageable steps.
